In this one, I’d like to share a bit about why I started this project and the journey that led me here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started programming when I was 13 years old. Even then, I was fascinated by the idea of creating games, which led me to learn C++, the programming language commonly used for game development. From that point on, I knew I wanted to become a programmer. Interestingly, becoming a game developer didn’t immediately cross my mind — probably because the industry wasn’t as large at the time, and most games were developed in the United States. It felt as distant as dreaming about working in Hollywood.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Devlog 2: Project Introduction</title><link>/posts/devlog2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 18:47:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/devlog2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Charming Hell</title><link>/projects/charminghell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 16:12:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>/projects/charminghell/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="project-info">Project Info&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The theme for the Winter Melon Jam 2023 was &amp;ldquo;Charm.&amp;rdquo; I was disappointed. I already had several cool game genres in mind that I was excited to try out. So my anticipation for the jam was huge. But &amp;ldquo;Charm&amp;rdquo;? What should I do with that? It did not fit any idea at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I had already set aside the three days, so I decided to give it a shot. The theme was announced around 6 pm., so I chose not to start programming that evening. Instead, I spent the rest of the night planning the following days and, most importantly, coming up with a game idea.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
