&lt;p>The theme for the Winter Melon Jam 2023 was &amp;ldquo;Charm.&amp;rdquo; I was disappointed. I already had several cool game genres in mind that I was excited to try out. So my anticipation for the jam was huge. But &amp;ldquo;Charm&amp;rdquo;? What should I do with that? It did not fit any idea at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I had already set aside the three days, so I decided to give it a shot. The theme was announced around 6 pm., so I chose not to start programming that evening. Instead, I spent the rest of the night planning the following days and, most importantly, coming up with a game idea.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Mining/Visualization Website</title><link>/project/datavisualization/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 16:12:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>/project/datavisualization/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="project-info">Project Info&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>This project had two main goals. First, &lt;a href="https://www.dipf.de/de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DIPF&lt;/a>
wanted to gain better insights into the data of the &lt;a href="https://www.iwwb.de/kurssuche/startseite.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IWWB&lt;/a>
meta-search engine. Second, they aimed to make the search engine more user-friendly, enabling users to easily find educational courses tailored to their interests and located near them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the data analysis, I wrote small algorithms to extract relevant data from the massive JSON database. One of the key features I implemented was a simple categorization algorithm that organizes courses into thematic categories based on customizable keywords. These data are visualized in various ways on the dashboard.
To enhance user-friendliness, I implemented a map with a search function. By using color-coded markers for course topics, users can explore their area for interesting courses with ease.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
