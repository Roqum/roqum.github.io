&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’m deeply interested in game engine programming and am seriously considering transitioning fully from game development to engine development. I love the combination of solving math-heavy challenges, writing performance-critical code, and designing thoughtful systems. That’s what led me to start this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This voxel engine serves as my learning environment. My goal is to build a simple voxel world using procedural generation and to focus on optimizing the rendering pipeline as much as possible. There are many algorithms I’ve read about and am eager to experiment with, combine, and refine. At the end, I want to gain a deep understanding of how things work under the hood in modern game engines.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chained By Eternity (Main Project)</title><link>/project/chainedbyeternity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 12:39:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>/project/chainedbyeternity/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="project-info">Project Info&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> &lt;br>
This project is built using &lt;strong>Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)&lt;/strong> and the &lt;strong>Gameplay Ability System (GAS)&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;re developing almost &lt;strong>entirely in C++&lt;/strong>, with minimal use of Blueprints.
Since this is a portfolio presentation and not a tutorial, I won’t go into detailed explanations of UE5 or GAS concepts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Charming Hell</title><link>/project/charminghell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 16:12:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>/project/charminghell/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="project-info">Project Info&lt;/h2>

&lt;h2 id="the-beginning">The Beginning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The theme for the Winter Melon Jam 2023 was &amp;ldquo;Charm.&amp;rdquo; I was disappointed. I already had several cool game genres in mind that I was excited to try out. So my anticipation for the jam was huge. But &amp;ldquo;Charm&amp;rdquo;? What should I do with that? It did not fit any idea at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I had already set aside the three days, so I decided to give it a shot. The theme was announced around 6 pm., so I chose not to start programming that evening. Instead, I spent the rest of the night planning the following days and, most importantly, coming up with a game idea.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Mining/Visualization Website</title><link>/project/datavisualization/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 16:12:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>/project/datavisualization/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="project-info">Project Info&lt;/h3>

&lt;h5 id="project-goal-and-implementation">Project Goal and Implementation&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>This project had two main goals. First, &lt;a href="https://www.dipf.de/de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DIPF&lt;/a>
wanted to gain better insights into the data of the &lt;a href="https://www.iwwb.de/kurssuche/startseite.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IWWB&lt;/a>
meta-search engine. Second, they aimed to make the search engine more user-friendly, enabling users to easily find educational courses tailored to their interests and located near them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the data analysis, I wrote small algorithms to extract relevant data from the massive JSON database. One of the key features I implemented was a simple categorization algorithm that organizes courses into thematic categories based on customizable keywords. These data are visualized in various ways on the dashboard.
To enhance user-friendliness, I implemented a map with a search function. By using color-coded markers for course topics, users can explore their area for interesting courses with ease.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
