&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m deeply interested in game engine programming and am seriously considering transitioning fully from game development to engine development. I love the combination of solving math-heavy challenges, writing performance-critical code, and designing thoughtful systems. That’s what led me to start this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This voxel engine serves as my learning environment. My goal is to build a simple voxel world using procedural generation and to focus on optimizing the rendering pipeline as much as possible. There are many algorithms I’ve read about and am eager to experiment with, combine, and refine. At the end, I want to gain a deep understanding of how things work under the hood in modern game engines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
This project is built using &lt;strong&gt;Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Gameplay Ability System (GAS)&lt;/strong&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re developing almost &lt;strong&gt;entirely in C++&lt;/strong&gt;, with minimal use of Blueprints.
Since this is a portfolio presentation and not a tutorial, I won’t go into detailed explanations of UE5 or GAS concepts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am creating this documentation to organize and deepen my knowledge of the Gameplay Ability System (GAS). Additionally, I’m happy if it can also help other developers along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This documentation is still a work in progress. I will continue to update and expand it as I gain more experience while working with GAS. I can’t guarantee for absolute accuracy, but I will do my best to present the topics as clearly and correctly as possible. If you find any incorrect informations or have suggestions for improvement, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me via email.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>#1 Why I’m Creating This Game</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/devlog/devlog1/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 18:47:54 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//localhost:1313/devlog/devlog1/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My game project will be introduced in the next devlog. In this one, I’d like to share a bit about why I started this project and the journey that led me here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started programming when I was 13 years old. Even then, I was fascinated by the idea of creating games, which led me to learn C++, the programming language commonly used for game development. From that point on, I knew I wanted to become a programmer. Interestingly, becoming a game developer didn’t immediately cross my mind — probably because the industry wasn’t as large at the time, and most games were developed in the United States. It felt as distant as dreaming about working in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>#2 Project Introduction</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/devlog/devlog2/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/devlog/devlog2/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may have read in the last devlog, this game is a showcase project. My goal is to expand and demonstrate my skills in game development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that goal in mind, I’ve decided not to create a fully-fledged game but rather a vertical slice of what could potentially be a complete game. As a solo developer, delivering a large amount of high-quality content is simply not feasible, especially since I’m also working full-time. For this reason, I’m focusing on the quality of the game, but I’ll need to limit the content, length, and complexity. The result will be more of a &amp;ldquo;vertical slice&amp;rdquo;—a &amp;ldquo;demo&amp;rdquo; with around 15 minutes of gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>#3 First Steps</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/devlog/devlog3/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;gameplay-ability-system&#34;&gt;Gameplay Ability System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Unreal Engine because I’m a C++ programmer, and there are plenty of resources available for UE development online. After some research, I decided to use the Gameplay Ability System developed by Epic Games. Originally created in conjunction with Paragon, it serves as a framework for developing multiplayer RPGs. The framework is both powerful and flexible—it’s not limited to RPGs. For example, it’s also used in the development of Fortnite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-beginning&#34;&gt;The Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme for the Winter Melon Jam 2023 was &amp;ldquo;Charm.&amp;rdquo; I was disappointed. I already had several cool game genres in mind that I was excited to try out. So my anticipation for the jam was huge. But &amp;ldquo;Charm&amp;rdquo;? What should I do with that? It did not fit any idea at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I had already set aside the three days, so I decided to give it a shot. The theme was announced around 6 pm., so I chose not to start programming that evening. Instead, I spent the rest of the night planning the following days and, most importantly, coming up with a game idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h5 id=&#34;project-goal-and-implementation&#34;&gt;Project Goal and Implementation&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project had two main goals. First, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dipf.de/de&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer nofollow&#34;&gt;DIPF&lt;/a&gt;
 wanted to gain better insights into the data of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iwwb.de/kurssuche/startseite.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer nofollow&#34;&gt;IWWB&lt;/a&gt;
 meta-search engine. Second, they aimed to make the search engine more user-friendly, enabling users to easily find educational courses tailored to their interests and located near them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the data analysis, I wrote small algorithms to extract relevant data from the massive JSON database. One of the key features I implemented was a simple categorization algorithm that organizes courses into thematic categories based on customizable keywords. These data are visualized in various ways on the dashboard.
To enhance user-friendliness, I implemented a map with a search function. By using color-coded markers for course topics, users can explore their area for interesting courses with ease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
