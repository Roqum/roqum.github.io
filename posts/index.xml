In this one, I’d like to share a bit about why I started this project and the journey that led me here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started programming when I was 13 years old. Even then, I was fascinated by the idea of creating games, which led me to learn C++, the programming language commonly used for game development. From that point on, I knew I wanted to become a programmer. Interestingly, becoming a game developer didn’t immediately cross my mind — probably because the industry wasn’t as large at the time, and most games were developed in the United States. It felt as distant as dreaming about working in Hollywood.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Devlog 2: Project Introduction</title><link>/posts/devlog2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 18:47:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/devlog2/</guid><description>&lt;p>As you may have read in the last devlog, this game is a showcase project. My goal is to expand and demonstrate my skills in game development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that goal in mind, I’ve decided not to create a fully-fledged game but rather a vertical slice of what could potentially be a complete game. As a solo developer, delivering a large amount of high-quality content is simply not feasible, especially since I’m also working full-time. For this reason, I’m focusing on the quality of the game, but I’ll need to limit the content, length, and complexity. The result will be more of a &amp;ldquo;vertical slice&amp;rdquo;—a &amp;ldquo;demo&amp;rdquo; with around 15 minutes of gameplay.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Devlog 3: First Steps</title><link>/posts/devlog3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 18:47:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/devlog3/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="gameplay-ability-system">Gameplay Ability System&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I chose Unreal Engine because I’m a C++ programmer, and there are plenty of resources available for UE development online. After some research, I decided to use the Gameplay Ability System developed by Epic Games. Originally created in conjunction with Paragon, it serves as a framework for developing multiplayer RPGs. The framework is both powerful and flexible—it’s not limited to RPGs. For example, it’s also used in the development of Fortnite.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
