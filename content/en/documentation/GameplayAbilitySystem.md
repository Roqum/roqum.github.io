## Introduction

I am creating this documentation to organize and deepen my knowledge of the Gameplay Ability System (GAS). Additionally, I’m happy if it can also help other developers along the way.

This documentation is still a work in progress. I will continue to update and expand it as I gain more experience while working with GAS. I can’t guarantee for absolute accuracy, but I will do my best to present the topics as clearly and correctly as possible. If you find any incorrect informations or have suggestions for improvement, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me via email.

If you need more resources, I highly recommend [tranek’s documentation](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation) on the Gameplay Ability System (GAS), which has been a great help to me during the development of my game. Additionally, I suggest looking into the GAS source code, which also serves as the "official" documentation. It contains tons of comments with detailed explanations.

I’m currently working with Unreal Engine 5.4, so this documentation is tailored to that version. Everything of it should work with other versions as well, but I can’t guarantee compatibility. If I’m aware of any version-specific issues, I will make a note of them in the documentation.
## Overview

If you’re here to learn GAS, I want to encourage you to stick with it. It’s a very powerful and well-designed tool, but it’s also quite complex. The good news is that you don’t need to fully understand all of GAS’s complexity to start working with it. However, it’s helpful to first grasp the basic concepts and how it works.
