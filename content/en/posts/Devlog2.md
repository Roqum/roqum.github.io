As you may have read in the last devlog, this game is a showcase project. My goal is to expand and demonstrate my skills in game development.

With that goal in mind, I’ve decided not to create a fully-fledged game but rather a vertical slice of what could potentially be a complete game. As a solo developer, delivering a large amount of high-quality content is simply not feasible, especially since I’m also working full-time. For this reason, I’m focusing on the quality of the game, but I’ll need to limit the content, length, and complexity. The result will be more of a "vertical slice"—a "demo" with around 15 minutes of gameplay.

The game itself will be a 3D top-down ARPG with Souls-like combat. The closest comparison would be No Rest for the Wicked. I chose this genre for various reasons, which I’ll explain further.

#### Why an RPG? Isn’t that too ambitious for a beginner?

Yes, it is. But I wouldn't consider myself as an beginner anymore. I’ve been learning about various aspects of game development for several years now, and even longer in software development. Still, creating an RPG is ambitious, and I spent a lot of time considering whether I wanted to take on this challenge.

On the other hand, an RPG is an excellent choice for me challinging myself and showcasing my knowledge.
An RPG includes many systems that, on their own, can become quite complex. These systems don’t operate in isolation but instead interact on many levels.

Take the attribute system, for example. You could keep it simple with just three attributes (Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence), or you could expand it with secondary attributes like damage resistances, critical hit chance, or dodge probability. This alone can already become intricate, but it still sounds manageable—it’s just a few numbers to calculate, right?

But this attribute system directly influences the combat system. How are damage and resistance values calculated? What impact do attributes have on abilities, and how do enemy attributes factor in?

This adds an entire new layer of complexity, and it doesn’t stop there. The list goes on: inventory and equipment also affect the combat system. Consumables, passive skills, character levels, item enchantments, crafting—there’s so much more. How quickly can a game become completely unbalanced if just a few numbers are off? And all of this is just one part of the game. There are countless other systems, such as the quest system, NPC dialogues, class system, and so on.

This is a huge challenge, but it’s one I’m consciously choosing to take on. I want to build a functional and scalable foundation that could support a full RPG. However, my focus will be on the technical, programming aspects of the systems, minimizing the workload in other areas like art, animation, sound, effects, story, and so on. The goal is to create as little content as possible while delivering a high-quality demo.
