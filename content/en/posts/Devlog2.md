As you may have read in the last devlog, this game is a showcase project. My goal is to expand and demonstrate my skills in game development.

With that goal in mind, I’ve decided not to create a fully-fledged game but rather a vertical slice of what could potentially be a complete game. As a solo developer, delivering a large amount of high-quality content is simply not feasible, especially since I’m also working full-time. For this reason, I’m focusing on the quality of the game, but I’ll need to limit the content, length, and complexity. The result will be more of a "vertical slice"—a "demo" with around 15 minutes of gameplay.

The game itself will be a 3D top-down ARPG with Souls-like combat. The closest comparison would be No Rest for the Wicked. I chose this genre for various reasons, which I’ll explain further.

#### Why an RPG? Isn’t that too ambitious for a beginner?

Yes, it is. But I wouldn't consider myself as an beginner anymore. I’ve been learning about various aspects of game development for several years now, and even longer in software development. Still, creating an RPG is ambitious, and I spent a lot of time considering whether I wanted to take on this challenge.

On the other hand, an RPG is an excellent choice for me to challinging myself and showcasing my knowledge.
An RPG includes many systems that, on their own, can become quite complex. These systems don’t operate in isolation but instead interact on many levels.

Take the attribute system, for example. This alone could already become intricate, but it still sounds manageable—it’s just a few numbers used to calculate stuff, right? But this attribute system is not set and done. It depens on multiple things and multiple things depens on it. Maybe the damage is calculated based on your attributes. Equipment you wear or usable items you use are changing these value and need to be considered asswell. What about passive abilities or active ones that interact with these attributes for a short duration. Does the enemy character also have attributes, are these changed by equipment or levels aswell? 

So there are many parts that interact in a RPG. It is very easy to mess some number up and the whole game is imbalanced or feels off. 
And these are just the mechanics of the a RPG game. What about the NPCs, the quest system and the progress in the storyline? 

This is a huge challenge, but it’s one I’m consciously choosing to take on. I want to build a functional and scalable foundation that could support a full RPG. However, my focus will be on the mechanics. Implementing them, with a little content and minimizing the workload in other areas I am not skilled at like art, animation, effects, story, sound and so on. I really want to deliver a high-quality game and for that I need to avoid content.
