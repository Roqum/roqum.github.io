My game project will be introduced in the next devlog. In this one, I’d like to share a bit about why I started this project and the journey that led me here.

I started programming when I was 13 years old. Even then, I was fascinated by the idea of creating games, which led me to learn C++, the programming language commonly used for game development. From that point on, I knew I wanted to become a programmer. Interestingly, becoming a game developer didn’t immediately cross my mind — probably because the industry wasn’t as large at the time, and most games were developed in the United States. It felt as distant as dreaming about working in Hollywood.

As the years passed, the industry evolved. What once seemed like a distant dream job now felt possible. With the rise of popular game engines like Unreal Engine, Unity, and CryEngine, as well as the emergence of many indie studios, even in Germany, my career path became more achievable.

And this brings me to the reason for starting this project. Until now, I hadn’t specifically focused on a career in game development. My personal projects spanned a variety of fields—from game development to websites and even neural networks. While this gave me broad and valuable experience, it wasn’t particularly tailored to game development positions.

What’s worse, almost none of my personal projects were documented. I didn’t realize how essential this would be for the application process. I had finished games, completed websites, and even some 3D graphics programming projects, but I have no proof of these achievements. Some projects were lost on old devices, others won’t run due to outdated dependencies, and a few simply vanished — I don’t even know where I lost them.

Without visible proof, I can’t convince recruiters of what I’m capable of. Not surprisingly, my applications to game companies right after graduation were unsuccessful.

I want to change that. I’ve allready decided to become a game developer, and that’s what I’m going to work for. To achieve this, I started this project to showcase my programming experience. For years, I’ve been involved in game development in various ways — working with game engines, exploring art, studying game design and much more. I’ve learned a lot but I could not prove it. I hope this project will change that and it will gain me more attention in my next application process.

Above all, for myself — but also for other developers — I want to document my progress and the knowledge I gain on my website. Maybe it will help someone along the way. For me, it definitely helps to organize what I’ve learned and to deepen my understanding.
