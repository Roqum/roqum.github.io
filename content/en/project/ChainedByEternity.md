## Intorduction

**Chained By Eternity** is my most ambitious and dedicated project to date. My goal with this project is to showcase my skills and finally land a job in the game development industry.

Together with a friend, we set out to build something technically challenging. We knew early on that building a full-scale ARPG like *Path of Exile* or *Diablo* would be unrealistic for a two-person team. Instead, we focused on creating a **high-quality vertical slice** a playable snapshot of what a complete game could be. This includes real-time combat, a fully functional ability and progression system, an inventory and item systems loot mechanics, and many other core features typically found in a classic action RPG.


## Technical Details

This project is built using **Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)** and the **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)**. We're developing almost **entirely in C++**, with minimal use of Blueprints.

### Overview 
We've already achieved a lot, but there's still a long road ahead. Many systems are implemented and working, but not yet at the level of quality we're aiming for. We're currently focused on building a solid foundation, following the principle:

> "Make it work first, make it good later."

Please keep that in mind when reading the overview below. Most of the listed systems are functional but still need polish and refinement. More details are provided in the following sections.

#### Features Already Implemented

- **Advanced Attribute System**  
  Modular and expandable attribute system with stat scaling and interactions.
- **Multiple Weapon Types**  
  Currently supports 3 weapon types with layered animations that change dynamically when switching weapons.
- **Inventory and Equipment System**  
  Allows players to manage items, equip, and unequip equipment.
- **Items**  
  Items can modify player attributes, grant new abilities when equipped or activate abilities when used.
- **Checkpoint System**  
  Basic save/load functionality to restore the player's game state.
- **Basic Enemy AI**  
  Simple behavior logic like chasing and attacking the player.
- **Combat Abilities**  
  Including single-target, area-of-effect (AOE), and projectile-based abilities.
- **UI**  
  Functional UI for the main menu, character creation, in-game HUD, and inventory management.
- **Loot Mechanics**  
  For complex item drop calculation based on enemy level and rarity.

#### Big Features Still in Development / Not Yet Implemented

- **Level Environment & Art**  
  Creating visually appealing level environment.
- **Enemy Spawn System**  
  Procedurally generated spawn algorithm for random enemy placement.
- **Quest System**  
  Including dialogues, progression tracking, and rewards.
- **Advanced AI**  
  Smarter enemy behavior for diffrent enemy type (Probably going for state trees).
- **Ability & Attribute Menus (UI)**  
  User interface for managing abilities and stats.
- **General Polish**  
  Refine animations, add effects and sound, optimize performance, etc.

### Showcase

Comming soon...
