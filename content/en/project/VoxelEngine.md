## Introduction
I’m deeply interested in game engine programming and am seriously considering transitioning fully from game development to engine development. I love the combination of solving math-heavy challenges, writing performance-critical code, and designing thoughtful systems. That’s what led me to start this project.

This voxel engine serves as my learning environment. My goal is to build a simple voxel world using procedural generation and to focus on optimizing the rendering pipeline as much as possible. There are many algorithms I’ve read about and am eager to experiment with, combine, and refine. At the end, I want to gain a deep understanding of how things work under the hood in modern game engines.
