### The Beginning

The theme for the Winter Melon Jam 2023 was "Charm." I was disappointed. I already had several cool game genres in mind that I was excited to try out. So my anticipation for the jam was huge. But "Charm"? What should I do with that? It did not fit any idea at all.

However, I had already set aside the three days, so I decided to give it a shot. The theme was announced around 6 pm., so I chose not to start programming that evening. Instead, I spent the rest of the night planning the following days and, most importantly, coming up with a game idea.
