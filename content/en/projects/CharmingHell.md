### Test

I developed this game for the three-day 'Melon Jam 2023' game jam. It's a strategic building game where the player races against time. The player's goal, as an evil landlord, is to make a piece of land as 'charming' as possible to earn as much money from tenants as possible. The fact that it's only a matter of time before this land is destroyed by natural disasters doesnâ€™t seem to bother him. The theme for this game jam, 'Charm', has been transformed into a 'charming hell'.
