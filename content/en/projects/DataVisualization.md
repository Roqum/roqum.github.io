##### Project Goal and Implementation

This project had two main goals. First, [DIPF](https://www.dipf.de/de) wanted to gain better insights into the data of the [IWWB](https://www.iwwb.de/kurssuche/startseite.html) meta-search engine. Second, they aimed to make the search engine more user-friendly, enabling users to easily find educational courses tailored to their interests and located near them.


For the data analysis, I wrote small algorithms to extract relevant data from the massive JSON database. One of the key features I implemented was a simple categorization algorithm that organizes courses into thematic categories based on customizable keywords. These data are visualized in various ways on the dashboard.
To enhance user-friendliness, I implemented a map with a search function. By using color-coded markers for course topics, users can explore their area for interesting courses with ease.

Since I delve extensively into the theoretical foundations and the implementation of the website in my bachelor's thesis, I won't elaborate further here. If you're interested, feel free to read my thesis; it's linked above.
