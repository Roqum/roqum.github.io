### About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m David - a full-time C++ software developer based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. I'm married and recently became a father to a three-month-old child.

I discovered programming at the age of 13 and quickly developed a strong interest in game development. Unfortunately, becoming a game programmer didnâ€™t feel like a realistic career path at the time, and I lost a few valuable years exploring other options.

However, my passion for programming never faded. I pursued a degree in computer science and began building a professional career as a software developer. Over time, my perspective on game development shifted - and Iâ€™m now more determined than ever to enter the industry.

In my free time, Iâ€™m developing a game using Unreal Engine 5, focusing heavily on C++ and the Gameplay Ability System (GAS). Itâ€™s a way to advance and showcase my game programming skills. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.david-burgstaller.de/project/ChainedByEternity)
